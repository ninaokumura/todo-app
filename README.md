### Useful resources

- [Custom checkbox](https://jakzaizzat.com/how-to-a-build-custom-checkbox-in-tailwindcss) - This helped me understand how to hide the input tag and create the custom design
- [tailwind-styles-components](https://www.npmjs.com/package/tailwind-styled-components) - It is a great tool to extract Tailwind classes and turned them into components, making the code more readable
